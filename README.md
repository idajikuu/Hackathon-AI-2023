Our project consists of three main processes: data scraping, preprocessing, and diffusion 1.5. Our team has worked hard to curate a dataset of diverse and authentic Moroccan interior designs through scraping data from various sources. We then preprocess this data to enhance its quality, using techniques such as data cleaning and normalization. Finally, we utilize the cutting-edge diffusion 1.5 algorithm to generate stunning, culturally-inspired interior designs.



We believe that our project has the potential to revolutionize the field of interior design, providing designers and homeowners alike with a powerful tool to effortlessly generate unique and inspiring designs that reflect the rich cultural heritage of Morocco.
